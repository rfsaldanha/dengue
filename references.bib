  abstract = {The success of machine learning (ML) systems depends on data availability, volume, quality, and efficient computing resources. A challenge in this context is to reduce computational costs while maintaining adequate accuracy of the models. This paper presents a framework to address this challenge. The idea is to identify ``subdomains'' within the input space, train local models that produce better predictions for samples from that specific subdomain, instead of training a single global model on the full dataset. We experimentally evaluate our approach on two real-world datasets. Our results indicate that subset modelling (i) improves the predictive performance compared to a single global model and (ii) allows data-efficient training.},
