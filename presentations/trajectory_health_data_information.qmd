## Some context

-   Undergrad on Geography (UFJF)

-   Specialization on Statistics (UFJF)

-   Master's at Public Health (UFJF)

-   PhD on Health Information and Communication (Fiocruz)

-   Postdoctoral researcher at Inria, France: *Institut national de recherche en sciences et technologies du numÃ©rique*

## Geography and health

-   Geography. The study of the earth and atmosphere and of human activity as it affects and is affected by these.

-   Health geography. Application of geographical information, methods and perspectives to study health-disease processes.

## Data science applied to public health

-   A perspective for *quantitative* health information

-   Spatial and time series of public health data of multiple formats

-   Classical and modern methods of data analysis

-   New ways of use and disseminate health information

## Thesis

-   From acquisition to data visualization: applications of data science on health

-   Study the cycle of generation and dissemination of health information

-   Presents a **new paradigm** of data science and health, considering the hybrid possibilities of a theory & data driven science for Public Health

-   and a **new process model** called Knowledge Discovery in Databases for Public Health (KDD-PH)

## KDD-PH

## Thesis results

-   Articles and products that fully or partially adopts the KDD-PH approach

## Theoretical construction

-   Data science and big data: what that means for population studies and health

-   To reflect on the possible changes that data science can induce in population and health related studies

-   Volume is not the most promising characteristic of big data for population and health related studies, but rather the **complexity of data** and the possibilities of integration with traditional studies by means of **interdisciplinary teams.**
