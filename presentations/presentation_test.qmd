## Building and Selecting Specialized AI Models for Predicting Dengue Disease

-   SALDANHA, Raphael
-   AKBARINIA, Reza
-   PENA, Eduardo
-   RIBEIRO, Victor
-   PORTO, Fabio

## Context

-   Raphael SALDANHA: Degrees on Geography, Statistics, Public Health and Health Information
-   Postdoc call from International Relations Department of Inria. Duration of 24 months (2023-2024)
-   Supervisors: Prof. Reza Akbarinia (Inria) and Prof. Fabio Porto (LNCC)

## Arboviruses

-   Dengue, Zika, Chikungunya, and other arboviruses imposes a significant burden over populations health
-   Endemic vector borne disease (Aedes mosquitoes)
-   Impacts all geographic regions in Brazil, with its continental extension
-   Follow spatial and seasonal trends

## Dengue spread

## Dengue transmission cycle

## Dengue symptons

## Aedes breeding sites

-   No need of clean water

-   Eggs sticks to container walls lige glue

-   They can survive drying out for up to **8 months**

## Dengue over time

and different regions

## Territory diversity

-   On rainy season, water accumulates on cans, pots and litter present at backyards and on the streets.

## Territory diversity

-   On dry season or droughts, water is stored on drums without lid.
-   The same predictor (ie. rain) may have different signal, in respect to other conditions.

## Modeling dengue cases

-   Dengue cases as target variable
-   Predictors
    -   Temperature, droughts, rainfall, floods, land use, deforestation
    -   Living conditions, urban environment
    -   Water supply, water rationing+

## Modeling intuition

-   **General models** tend to ignore the **diversity** of the territory
    -   Different or even contradictory predictors relationship with the outcome
    -   Dengue transmission follows different rules, affected by climate and culture
-   **Local models** are basically **restricted**, not useful for different regions and dengue transmission regimes
-   A **single** machine-learning model is not a good option due the Brazilian diversity

## Aproach

-   Separate Brazilian municipalities into clusters, maximizing their similarity regarding dengue transmissions and its covariate's importance and signals
-   Train several ML models of different strategies for each cluster
-   Considering a query region r, select models with the best accuracy from related clusters to r, and ensemble the models into a single model, tailored for the specific region
-   Predict cases using the ensemble model and compare its results with a baseline model trained with all data

## Global and subsets models

```

## Expected results

-   More precise predictions for regions, with data "closer" to the training data.
-   Parallelism in training models on different regions, less costs.
-   Reduce the impact of concep-drift models of the affected regions.
-   Provide health managers with tools, predictions and scenarios adequate to different scales of health surveillance, preparedness and field action \_ Contribute to public health policies formulation and implementation
