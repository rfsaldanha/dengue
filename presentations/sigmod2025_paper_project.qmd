## Motivation

-   Complex data may present internal diversity

-   ML systems may present a good **overall** performance

-   But it is not **uniformly equal** on all parts of the input

## Objective

-   Propose a ML **framework** that accounts for **shared characteristics** and **regional variations** across a domain dataset

## Method

1.  Given a dataset $D$, **train** a global ML model $G$

2.  **Identify** a number of subsets $S$ on $D$

3.  **Train** ML models on each $S_i$

4.  For inference, **assign** the incoming sample to the corresponding $S_k$

5.  **Compare** the performance observed on $G$ and $S$ models for each unit

```

## Method

-  The subset may have *a priori* definitions

-  Or identified with **data-driven methods**, like **clustering** techniques



## Datasets

-  **Dengue dataset**. Contains 10 year time series of dengue cases incidence on Brazilian municipalities and related predictors, as temperature and rainfall.
   -  The subsets models rendered a better performance on 116 out of 333 municipalities: a **improvement of 34.83%**.

-  We need **another dataset** to help generalize our findings.

## GeoLifeCLEF 2023 competition

-  Large-scale training dataset of 5M plant occurrences 
-  Validation set of 5K plots
-  Test set with 20K plots
-  Baseline model Spatial Random Forest (PA), trained with Presence-Absence data and longitude/latitude as covariates
