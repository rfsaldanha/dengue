## Context

-   Raphael SALDANHA: Degrees on Geography, Statistics, Public Health and Health Information
-   Postdoc call from International Relations Department of Inria. Duration of 24 months (2023-2024)
-   Supervisors: Prof. Reza Akbarinia (Inria) and Prof. Fabio Porto (LNCC)

## Arboviruses

-   Dengue, Zika, Chikungunya, and other arboviruses imposes a significant burden over populations health
-   Endemic vector borne disease (Aedes mosquitoes)
-   Impacts all geographic regions in Brazil, with its continental extension
-   Follow spatial and seasonal trends

## Modeling dengue outbreaks

-   Dengue cases as target variable
-   Predictors
    -   Temperature, droughts, rainfall, floods, land use, deforestation
    -   Living conditions, urban environment
    -   Water supply, water rationing
    -   Mosquito infestation? Only few and localized data available.

## Territory diversity

-   On rainy season, water accumulates on cans, pots and litter present at backyards, junkyards and on the streets.

## Territory diversity

-   On dry season or droughts, water is stored on open drums.
-   The same predictor (ie. rain) may have different signal, in respect to other conditions.

## Modeling considerations

-   **General models** tend to ignore the **diversity** of the territory
-   **Local models** are basically **restricted**, not useful for different regions and dengue transmission regimes
-   A **single** machine-learning model is not a good option due the Brazilian diversity

## Global and subsets models

~Consider each square as a municipality~

## Subsets approach

-   Model 1: global model, with all municipalities data
-   Model 2: subset models
    -   Group Brazilian municipalities into clusters
    -   Train several ML models for each cluster
    -   Compare the accuracy with the global model
-   Predict cases using the model with best accuracy

## Workflow

A[All data] --> G[Global Model]

G --> P1[Predictions]

```

## Key decisions

-   How to cluster municipalities based on time series data?

    -   Outcome (dengue cases)

    -   Predictors

-   What are the best predictors for **forecast**?

    -   Choice of lags and rolling windows

-   What are the best ML algorithms to forecast dengue cases?

## Expected results

-   More precise predictions for regions
-   Less dependency on specific data availability for each municipality
-   Provide health managers with tools, predictions and scenarios adequate to different scales of health surveillance, preparedness and field action
-   Contribute to public health policies formulation and implementation
