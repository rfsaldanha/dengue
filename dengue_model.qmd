In this section there are notebooks for dengue modelling.

## Dengue and lagged weather variables

The goal is to investigate the relationship between weather variables and dengue cases in different time lags. Despite applying a decision tree algorithm, the focus is to examine how concurrent lags of weather variables impacts dengue cases incidence and not the overall model predictive performance.

The classification task notebook classify dengue incidence as outbreak and normal level by using an anomaly regression algorithm. The regression task notebook uses directly the dengue incidence count.

## Predict dengue diagnose by symptoms and clinical conditions

The objective is to predict dengue diagnosis solely on patient symptoms and clinical conditions.
